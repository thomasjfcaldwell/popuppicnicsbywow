				<h3>
					Q: WHAT HAPPENS IF ONE OR MORE OF MY PAID GUESTS CANNOT MAKE MY
					BOOKING ON THE DAY OF OUR POP-UP PICNIC?
				</h3>
				<p>
					A: Since we do not offer refunds, we suggest that you find someone to
					take the place of anyone that has been paid for and cannot attend. We
					understand that sickness and unexpected situations do occur, so your
					best option is to find someone else who can attend and enjoy this
					amazing POP-UP Picnic experience.
				</p>
				<h3>Q: SHOULD I INCLUDE MY KIDS IN THE GUEST COUNT WHEN BOOKING?</h3>
				<p>
					A: If you are planning a picnic for a group of adults and young
					children, we suggest you only count the adults and add a note when
					booking that there will be young kids. We usually find that the kids
					tend to run around and or sit on parents’ laps and we do not charge
					extra for this. If you would like a place set at the table for any
					children, we suggest including them in your headcount.
				</p>
				<h3>Q: DO I NEED A PERMIT FOR MY PICNIC?</h3>
				<p>
					A: That depends on the location, number of guests and a few other
					factors. POP-UP Picnics Packages offered include any required permits.
